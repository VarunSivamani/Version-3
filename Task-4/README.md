# Task-4

- Write a simple 4 layer convolution neural network, to be trained on MNIST. 
- While the training is going on, i want to see the training logs and loss curves on an html page. 
- Use simple python server to do this. After training is done, show model results on 10 random images picked from MNIST database. 
- Use CUDA for training. Write all the files, including HowTo.md file describing the steps.
- Update the train.py file to use tdqm and add logs for each step. Use batch size of 512.
- Update the code, and also show accuracy, both in the logs as well as on the frontend.
- Since the accuracy is in high 90s, show accuracy in such a way that we can see movements between 90-100% on the graph.
